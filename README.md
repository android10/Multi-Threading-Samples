## Running Samples
Since this is still a WIP, running these examples require a bit of manual setup:

* Clone the repo and import it the project in Android Studio.
* In the files folder, you will find 2 .xml files used for the example: https://github.com/android10/Multi-Threading-Samples/tree/master/files
* Place them somewhere in your local storage inside your device.
* Change the paths to point to your location. You do it in this class: https://github.com/android10/Multi-Threading-Samples/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/fernandocejas/sample/threading/data/Source.kt
